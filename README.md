 ## 📘 Overview 
**ft_printf** is a project from **42 School** where you re-create the behavior of the C standard `printf()` for a subset of conversions.  
The main goal is to learn how to handle a variable number of arguments (`stdarg.h`) and to design clean, extensible formatting code.

You will implement `ft_printf()` and package it as a static library `libftprintf.a` so it can be reused later.
